      <h1 id="title">Safeguarding</h1>
      <p>Underland is committed to protecting the health, well-being and human rights of any and all participants of the BASH Festival of Code. This policy outlines the measures that we employ to ensure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>that nobody is subjected to abuse, harm or neglect</li>
        <li>that	everybody is able to experience the festival within a safe and supportive environment</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Applicability and Scope</h2>
      <p>Any and all measures stated in this policy are the responsibility of at least one or more of the following parties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><n-link to='/about/team'>The BASH Festival of Code Team</n-link></li>
        <li>Hub Leaders</li>
        <li>Week Mentors</li>
        <li>Weekend Volunteers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These responsible parties have a duty of care to implement this policy, and where this falls outside of their individually assigned remit, ensure that the appropriate responsible person takes responsibility.</p>
      <h2>Measures Prior to the event</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks</b>
          <p>As a cornerstone of our commitment to ensuring that any and all volunteers taking part in the festival are appropriately suited to the responsibility of working with young people, every volunteer will be required to pass a new Enhanced DBS check, or provide details for us to verify an existing check using the DBS Update Service.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Permission from a parent of guardian</b>
          <p>Any child wishing to take part in the festival must have their attendance explicitly supported by a parent or guardian, and said parent or guardian will be involved in all pertinent ticketing and attendance correspondence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Training</b>
          <p>All Hub Leaders will receive training to ensure that they can provide their duty of care in accordance with the stated terms of this Safeguarding Policy. This also includes training around our Incident Response Policy (we're still writing this), working with young people who are on the autism spectrum, and how to spot and report abuse.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Measures During the Festival Week (Monday - Friday)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Regional Hub Venues</b>
          <p>Venues designated as work spaces for hubs must be subject to an advance survey by Hub Leaders to ensure they comply with our Health & Safety Policy (currently being finalised) and that they meet the following security requirements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>venues must be enclosed spaces with access control for authorised people only</li>
            <li>where they are part of a larger space, venues will be appropriately secured and closed off from access by unauthorised people</li>
            <li>proposed venue assessments must be submitted by Hub Leaders and approved by the Regional Hub Coordinator prior to the BASH Festival of Code week</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DBS Checked Adults</b>
          <p>Work spaces will be attended by multiple DBS checked adults at all times. We will work with each Hub Leader to ensure there is a contingency plan to ensure that there is as even a spread of personnel on hand to remove any eventuality of lone-working or interruption of work sessions until cover supervision can be sourced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medical & Accessibility Requirements</b>
          <p>Each young person's medical and accessibility requirements, and parent/guardian contact information, will be collated at the ticketing stage and made available only to Hub Leaders and core BASH Festival team members. More details about your data are in our <n-link to='/policies/privacy'>Privacy Policy</n-link>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Attendance of Parents and Guardians</b>
          <p>While we discourage parents/guardians from attending in most cases, if there are any cases where a young person requires the presence of their parent/guardian then this need will be assessed on a case by case basis and accommodated where feasible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Code of Conduct</b>
          <p>Any and all participants, Hub Leaders, Mentors, Volunteers and BASH Festival of Code team members must agree and abide by our <n-link to='/policies/conduct'>Code of Conduct</n-link>.</p>
          <p>In the event of a Code of Conduct violation by any parties, reports can be made via email, Twitter Direct Message, telephone or anonymously online. Reports will be restricted to core BASH Festival team members for investigation. Details about reporting are in our <n-link to='/policies/conduct'>Code of Conduct</n-link></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Measures During the Weekend (Saturday - Sunday)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Host Venue</b>
          <p>The <n-link to='/weekend/venue'>host venue, Millenium Point</n-link>, is a public space, however:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Within the venue, all spaces and utilities that will be accessible by participants are exclusively for their use for the duration of the weekend's events.</li>
            <li>Access points for entry/exit will be staffed at all times by authorised personnel to ensure an accurate register of whereabouts at all times.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sleeping Spaces</b>
          <p>Each sleeping space will be monitored by its own register, with only those young people present on that space's register being granted access to come and go.</p>
          <p>Mixed-gender sleeping spaces will be supervised by multiple DBS-checked adults at all times.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Access to quiet spaces</b>
          <p>Young people affected by hypersensory conditions will be afforded access to designated areas such that they may more comfortably manage their experience of the event </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Receiving and Handing Off Attendees</h2>
      <h3>When no Permission to attend has been granted</h3>
      <p>In the eventuality of young people for whom we do not have a completed permission form arriving to take part in activities, either at their regional hub or at the weekend finale, the BASH team will implement a duty of care to host that young person until a parent/guardian can be contacted to either grant the outstanding permission, or collect the young person if they do not consent to that person attending.</p>
      <h3>When no parent/guardian is able to drop off or collect an attendee</h3>
      <p>Young persons with approved tickets of 16 years or older may arrive and depart from the event unaccompanied.</p>
      <p>Young persons with approved tickets under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a parent/guardian when being dropped off and collected from the venue their activities are being held at.</p>
      <p>If a young person under 16 arrives at their event unaccompanied, they will be permitted to participate in the event but cannot be released at the end of the session unless collected by a parent/guardian. in this instance the Hub Leader will notify a member of the BASH Team to contact the parent/guardian to ensure this action is followed through.</p>
      <p>If a young person under 16 is persistently or unreasonably unaccompanied to and from activities then this may constitute a violation of our Safeguarding Policy.</p>
      <h2>Changes to policy</h2>
      <p>This policy might change over time, which we reserve the right to do without notice. If we do make edits, you'll find them listed below.</p>
